## SQL course finale assignment as a summary.

### Assignment Description

1. Load the Data:
    * Create a `pandemic` schema in the database using an SQL command.
    * Select it as the default schema using an SQL command.
    * Import [the data](./assets/task-dataset/infectious_cases.csv) using the Import wizard.
    * Review the data to get familiar with the context.

2. `Entity` and `Code` attributes are repeated constantly. Eliminate this redundancy through data normalization.
   Normalize the `infectious_cases` table to the 3rd normal form. Save two tables with the normalized data in the same schema.

3. Analyze the Data:
    * For each unique combination of `Entity` and `Code` or their `id`, calculate the average, minimum, maximum, and sum for the `Number_rabies` attribute.
        ðŸ’¡ Note that the `Number_rabies` attribute may contain empty values `''` â€” you need to filter these out beforehand.
    * Sort the results by the calculated average value in descending order.
    * Select only 10 rows for display.

4. Build a Year Difference Column

    For the original or normalized table for the field `Year`, use built-in SQL functions to:

    * Create an attribute that represents the first of January of the corresponding year,
        ðŸ’¡ For example, if the attribute contains the value `1996`, the new attribute value should be `1996-01-01`.
    * Create an attribute that equals the current date,
    * Create an attribute that equals the difference in years between the two aforementioned columns.
        ðŸ’¡ There is no need to recalculate all other attributes, such as `Number_malaria`.

5. Create Your Own Function
    * Create and use a function that builds an attribute like in the previous task: the function should take the year value as input and return the difference in years between the current date and the date created from the year attribute (e.g., 1996 â†’ '1996-01-01').
        ðŸ’¡ If you didn't complete the previous task, you could create another function - a function that calculates the number of cases over a specific1. Write an SQL query that extracts the year, month, and day from the `date` attribute of the `orders` table. Display them as three separate attributes along with the `id` attribute and the original `date` attribute (a total of 5 attributes).
